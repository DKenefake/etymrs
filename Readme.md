# Etym.rs

This is a tool in progress for analysing the etymological background of entire sections text. Instead of looking at a single word at a time, allows for whole document scanning. This library is able to process large text documents quickly, for example Ulysses by James Joyce can be processed in about a tenth of a second on a modern laptop.

### Some Notes

This will not differentiate situations were the same word will have the multiple different backgrounds. Such as the word 'or', which has the usage of "tea or coffee" and "gold/yellow". One has germanic background and the other has a latin background. In general, this is a hard problem to get around.
