# Etym.rs

This is a tool in progress for analysing the entymological background of entire sections text. Instead of looking at a single word at a time, allows for whole document scanning.

### Some Notes

This will not differentiate situtations were the same word will have the multiple different backgrounds. Such as the word 'or', which has the usage of "tea or coffee" and "gold or yellow". One has germanic background and the other has a latin background.
### Features

 - [x] Database connection to Etymological Database
 - [x] Summary of lanuages
 - [ ] CLI Interface
